\section{Conclusion}
In this tutorial, various features of VHDL designs are discussed briefly. We designed the two bit comparator with four modeling styles i.e. dataflow, structural, behavioral and mixed styles. Also, differences between the generated-designs with these four methods are shown. Lastly, packages are discussed to store the common declaration in the designs.
